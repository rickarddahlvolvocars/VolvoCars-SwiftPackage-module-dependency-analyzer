# VolvoCars-SwiftPackage-module-dependency-analyzer

This is a Mac app/command line tool that:
* Analyzes the VolvoCars app repo (Workspace, Projects, SwiftPacakges folder, Packages.resolved and all Swift modules's Package.swift files)
* Builds up data structures with the relations
* Creates web files and presents the data using the D3 library

The intention is that we can use this tool to visualize the dependencies in any way we want to â€“ there's a lot of different graph types available!

For more info on D3:
